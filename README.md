# Exchanges profiles UI

## What? Why?

* **create-react-app** - easy to bootstrap new project. Just install and go!
* **antd** - components' library I am currently most familiar with. Just to speed up the development.
* **prettier, eslint, husky** - quicker and easier development as I do not need to think about code formatting.
* **react-query** - Always wanted to try out something else than global state management.
* **typescript** - Much easier to work with more complex applications, at least that is my experience.
* **css-modules** - Simple CSS without global collision problem.
